# Changelog

The Obsidian plugin's own history. The version is the root `manifest.json`'s;
the format is [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-10-07

Nothing changes in the plugin: the same frame, from the same DBML Studio
build, as in 0.2.3. The plugin now lives in its own repository,
AKonyshev/obsidian-dbml-studio, and takes the frame from the dbml-frame
package rather than from the DBML Studio repository.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- The diagram frame inside `main.js` is built with current libraries, among
  them version 10 of the DBML parser. Notes draw the same diagrams as in
  0.2.2, but `main.js` is 3.9 MB in place of 2.5.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-06

Nothing changes in the plugin: `main.js`, the frame it carries and the styles
behave as in 0.2.1. The release exists so the directory's review reads the
repository again. Its last report could not install the repository's
dependencies, and the root `.yarnrc` now lets that install finish on an older
Node.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-06

The directory's automated review flagged code in the repository; this release
carries the fixes, so the review reads them.

### Fixed

- Dragging the diagram kept its grabbing hand only until the pointer crossed
  a relation's button: leaving the button set the cursor back to the arrow
  mid-drag. It now stays the hand until the drag ends.
- After the first drag of the diagram, or the first visit to a relation's
  button, the frame's cursor stayed an arrow everywhere, over text too. It
  now goes back to the ordinary one.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-06

Made for Obsidian's Community plugins directory.

### Added

- An English interface. Block errors, notices and the command name are in
  English, and in Russian when Obsidian's own language is Russian. The
  command is "Refresh diagrams" ("Обновить диаграммы" in Russian).

### Changed

- Installed from Obsidian's Community plugins: Settings → Community plugins
  → Browse, "DBML Studio". The zip on the GitHub release still installs by
  hand.
- The diagram frame travels inside `main.js`. On the first start, and after
  each update, the plugin writes it into `frame/` in its own folder; a start
  with an up-to-date frame writes nothing. Nothing is downloaded.
- Needs Obsidian 1.13.7 or later, the version it is checked on.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

The first release. Installed by unzipping `dbml-studio-obsidian-0.1.0.zip`
into a vault's `.obsidian/plugins/`; desktop only, because models are read
from outside the vault.

### Added

- A ` ```dbml ` block that names a `model:` is drawn as an ER diagram in
  the note: the whole model, or the tables the block lists, at the height it
  asks for.
- The diagram follows Obsidian's light and dark theme unless the block pins
  one, and keeps its view and layout when the theme changes.
- "Обновить диаграммы" re-reads every model on screen.
- A diagram can be expanded over its note's pane, and Escape puts it back.
- A note opened in a popout window draws its diagrams there too, keeps
  following the theme, and keeps its diagrams when its tab moves to another
  window.
- A diagram loads when it first comes on screen, so the copy of a note
  Obsidian keeps hidden costs no memory.
- A ` ```dbml ` block of DBML code stays code.
